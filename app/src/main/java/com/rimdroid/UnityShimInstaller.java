/**
 * Runs RimWorld 1.6 through a relocatable stand-in for its launcher binary, on the devices that need it.
 *
 * <p>RimWorld's {@code RimWorldLinux} is a non-PIE executable: it only runs from one fixed low address.
 * On some phones that address belongs to someone else — on a Huawei Kirin 8000 the Android runtime's
 * Java heap spans 0x10000-0x32010000 from the moment the process is created — and box64 then cannot
 * load the game at all. A non-PIE image cannot be moved, so the launcher itself has to go.
 *
 * <p>On 1.6 that launcher is 14 KB that loads UnityPlayer.so and calls PlayerMain; our stand-in
 * ({@code shim/rd_unity_shim.c}, built as PIE) does the same and loads at any address. It is installed
 * under the original name, with the original kept as {@code RimWorldLinux.rdorig}, so argv[0] and
 * /proc/self/exe still resolve RimWorldLinux_Data the way Unity expects.
 *
 * <p>This only happens where it is needed: the native constructor in rimdroid.c reserves the low range
 * at library-load time and publishes {@code RIMDROID_ELF_RESERVE} when it succeeds. If that variable is
 * present the game's own binary can be placed as usual and we restore it; the swap is therefore
 * self-correcting and leaves every working device on exactly the path it uses today.
 *
 * <p>1.5 is out of scope: there the launcher is ~2 MB with SDL2 statically linked in, and UnityPlayer.so
 * resolves SDL symbols from it, so a bare stand-in would break windowing and input.
